                        Before 2020, the governments of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger collaborated with Western allies in counterterrorism efforts, maintaining a "pro-Western" stance against the two main violent extremist groups in the region: The Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) and Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), 
                        an Al-Qaeda Branch. France launched Operation Barkhane in 2014, deploying troops across the Sahel, including these three nations, to combat jihadist insurgencies. The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), established in 2013, worked to stabilize northern Mali, 
                        support political transitions, protect civilians, and promote human rights amid conflict. The U.S. also contributed through intelligence support, training, and equipping local forces. Together, Western and Sahelian militaries conducted joint counterinsurgency operations to address the growing threat of terrorism
                         in the region. Despite substantial Western military assistance, the resilience and adaptability of extremist groups, coupled with internal challenges, hindered the complete restoration of stability in the region.

                    <p>
                        Each country in the Sahel—Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger—experienced coups, replacing democratically elected governments with military juntas. Mali faced coups in 2020 and 2021, Burkina Faso experienced two in 2022, and Niger underwent one in 2023. Following these transitions, all three nations began distancing themselves 
                        from Western alliances and security partnerships, eventually forming their own Alliance of Sahel States (ASS) in 2024 to enhance cooperation in defense, economic development, and infrastructure projects. The Sahelian countries also expelled Western allies who had been aiding their counterterrorism efforts. France withdrew 
                        its forces from Mali in August 2022, Burkina Faso in February 2023, and Niger in December 2023, all at the request of the ruling juntas. The UN peacekeeping mission in Mali ended in 2023 after military leaders demanded its departure, and the U.S. withdrew its presence from Niger in September 2024 at the junta's request.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        The aftermath of these coups saw militant groups exploiting the instability, escalating attacks in both scale and frequency after the collapse of international security partnerships. By August 2024, the Africa Center for Strategic Studies estimated that 60% of Burkina Faso's territory was outside military control, while in Mali it was 50%.

                            Since their respective coups, each military junta has received diplomatic backing from Russia and requested its assistance in combating militant groups. Russia has deployed hundreds of personnel from its paramilitary group, Wagner, and its successor under direct control of Russia's Ministry of Defense, the Africa Corps. 
                            Beginning in Mali in 2021, the junta negotiated the deployment of an estimated 1,000 Wagner paramilitary forces as part of a $10.9 million/month deal that also granted Wagner access to critical minerals and Malian gold mines. Burkina Faso and Niger followed suit, with Russian forces deploying to each country in early 2024 
                            under similar agreements. Non-coincidentally, there has been a significant increase in violence against civilians by military security forces partnered with Russia's paramilitary group. According to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, attacks against civilians by security forces increased by 76% between 2022 and 2024. 
                            In Mali alone, the UN has implicated Wagner, acting alongside Malian security forces, in more than 320 incidents of human rights abuses. Thus, the Sahelian nations, partnering with Russian forces, have taken a markedly different approach compared to their former Western allies, who prioritized minimizing civilian casualties 
                            in their counterterrorism efforts.

                            The first map depicts violent events when all three countries maintained democratically elected leaders and received support from France, the U.S., and the UN in operations against Islamic militant groups. 
                            The militant groups were primarily active in the Sahel tri-border region, with the number of violent events in 2019 at 719. As coups plagued the three Sahel states, Western military operations and support in 
                            combating violent extremist organizations decreased, ultimately withdrawing at the request of the host nations, who then turned to Russia for assistance. Under the control of military juntas, the three nations 
                            struggled to maintain control over their territories, resulting in the expansion of violent events into areas previously unaffected. The scale of attacks conducted by militant groups also increased significantly, 
                            reaching 2,657 violent events in 2024—more than triple the number recorded in 2019. This increase in violence is further illustrated in the bar chart below.

                        <li>
                            In late March of 2022, Malian security forces, partnered with the Wagner Group, killed over 500 civilians, perpetrated acts of sexual violence, and used torture in the town of Moura, Mali. Detailed later in a report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the operation was found to have violated international humanitarian and human rights laws. The report highlighted mass executions, systemic abuses, and the displacement of thousands of residents, concluding that these acts likely constituted war crimes and potentially crimes against humanity. The event became known as the Moura massacre.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In late July 2024 in northern Mali, Wagner Group mercenaries, currently known as Africa Corps, were ambushed and routed by several hundred Tuareg rebels and al-Qaeda militants. According to the New York Times, at least 46 Wagner fighters and 24 allied Malian soldiers were killed. This event is Wagner's largest loss on the continent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On August 24, 2024, the Al-Qaeda-linked Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen, JNIM) attacked hundreds of civilians who were digging a military trench to protect Barsalogho, a remote town which has a military base. The attackers also fired upon many other civilians in the vicinity of the trench. Human Rights Watch confirmed through video analysis and witness accounts that at least 133 people were killed, including dozens of children, and at least 200 more were injured.

                <p class="lead">
                    Since taking power, the military juntas in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have failed to deliver on promises of restoring security, with violence linked to militant Islamist groups doubling and fatalities tripling under their rule according to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. The withdrawal of international, regional, and UN forces has left a security vacuum now filled by violent militant groups, exacerbating instability. Human rights abuses by the juntas along with their Russian partners have surged. Economic mismanagement 
                    and deteriorating living conditions further destabilize the region, with power outages in Mali, debt defaults in Niger, and mass displacement contributing to the worsening humanitarian crisis. The Sahel's shift to partnerships with Russia has marked a stark departure from former Western alliances, yet this strategy has failed to curb violence or restore stability, leaving the region in a deepening cycle of conflict and governance challenges.
